1. Looking at the backtrace output, which function called syscall?
usertrap() at kernel/trap.c

2. What is the value of p->trapframe->a7 and what does that value represent?
 p->trapframe->a7 is 7, #define SYS_exec    7

3. What was the previous mode that the CPU was in?
the value was 0, which means previous mode was supervisor mode
SPP bit is the 8th bit of the sstatus register
sstatus: 00100010

4. Write down the assembly instruction the kernel is panicing at. Which register corresponds to the variable num?
  // num = p->trapframe->a7;
  num = * (int *) 0;
    80002052:	00002683          	lw	a3,0(zero) # 0 <_entry-0x80000000>
so a3

5. Why does the kernel crash?
According to RISC-V privileged instructions, the value 13 here represents a load page fault. 
In particular, an error occurred while loading data from memory address 0 into a3
address 0 does not map to the kernel space


6. What is the name of the binary that was running when the kernel paniced? What is its process id (pid)?
initcode; 1
